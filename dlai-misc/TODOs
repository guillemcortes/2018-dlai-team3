# TODO List 

## Theory
- [X] Read CycleGAN paper
- [X]Â Comment paper Q&A 

## Understand implementation
- [X] Code review
- [ ] gather info on networks (see cycleGAN-networks.md)


## Development
- [X] Google Colab integration (inference and train)
- [ ] Google Cloud VM integration (inference and train)
- [ ] Small Cycle-Gan from zero
- [ ] Use trained networks with new dataset input (document it)
- [ ] Retrain with just one unfreezed layer (fit in memory)
- [ ] Test different layers/networks retraining with new datasets
- [ ] Networks fine-tuning 


## Experiments
