In this project we learnt to get our hands dirty with the implementation details, the setup and the architecture of the networks. 
We also gained a deeper knowledge of how the generator and discriminator networks work and their training processes.
We played with code that builds famous network architectures, ResNet, PatchGAN, cycleGAN...
We tried to tackle transfer style for new domains and we built GAN and cycleGANS from zero.
We also learnt how some of the deeper implementations, while giving good results require a lot of computing power and how to overcome this limitation when resources are limited.
We saw that the cycleGAN, when properly implemented has the potential of transforming within domains while keeping enough information of the image to recognise it and to do the reverse transformation
