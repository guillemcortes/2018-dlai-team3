## Advantages and disadvantages of using a cicleGAN for image2image generation.

### PROS:

- It generates a bidirectional mapping. Meaning you can get images of either domain to be generated by the same trained system.

- It keeps more information of the input image while changing it's domain.

### CONS:

- 4 deep networks to train means a it takes a lot of time and computational power.

- Since there are twice as many adversarial networks that need to find an equilibrium during training there is another there's a higher chance that training may fail to converge to a useful representation.

##Project layout:

Our project is split in two scopes:

- Replicate [CycleGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf) results.
- Implement a "Hello World" GAN & CycleGAN from scratch.
