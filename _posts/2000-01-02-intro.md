Image to image translation (e.g. style transfer) is a very studied problem in machine learning and many solutions have been proposed and put into production. However all of this solutions rely on having paired data.
With the advent of the GANs, one the most revolutionary concepts in Deep Learning
in the last few years a new "concept" appears: we can create images with  a certain criteria without having paired data.
This leaves the question: How we can keep the content (semantic content) of the original photo but with the style of a new one?

Here's where cycleGANs enters the picture. It's a set of GANS that keep the content of the original image and is capable transforming it between one domain and another.

The aim of this project is to understand one of the newest and more
revolutionary concepts in deep learning: the GANs. And furthermore,
the CycleGANs.

We started studying cicleGAN by studying [the paper that first proposed it](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593) and it's network. This made us realize in order to understand cycleGANs we needed to understand the problem it's come to resolve and the technology it's been built upon.

# A brief history of image to image solutions

### [A neural algorithm for artistic style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576)

![Proposed network](./assets/basicstyletransfer.png)

The first implementation of style transfer in the realm of neural networks took a CNN trained for image classification and separated the part of it that learnt texture information. Applying it to a new image. It used a square error loss  to minimize the distance between the 2 feature representations extracted from passing a white noise image and a picture trough the network.




### Ezequiel part SOLUTIONS + prons & cons

# Advantages and disadvantages of using a cicleGAN for image2image generation.

## PROS:

- It generates a bidirectional mapping. Meaning you can get images of either domain to be generated by the same trained system.

- It keeps more information of the input image while changing it's domain.

## CONS:

- 4 deep networks to train means a it takes a lot of time and computational power.



Our project is split in two scopes:
- Replicate [CycleGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf) results.
- Implement a "Hello World" GAN & CycleGAN from scratch.
