We have trained the CycleGAN for the Horse to Zebra dataset for 2 epochs. We tested this shortly trained model and the pretrained model prepared by the authors of the paper. A glimpse to the result is the following:

### Mini-CYCLEGAN
for a better understanding of the cyclegan we decided to implement a tiny/basic
cycleGAN and compare it with its homologue GAN.
For this we decided to work with one of the simplest and widely extended
benchmark dataset: the MNIST. So, our purpose is to generate MNIST numbers 
using a GAN and a cycle GAN.
We implement it ni pytorch and using CPU and GPU computational power.
We development has been carried out in google cloud plattform.
